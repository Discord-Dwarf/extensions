# Dwarf Extension Index

**DwEI** â€“ the Dwarf Extension Index.
DwEI stores meta-data describing Dwarf extensions written by people from all over the world. If you have written an extrnsion for Dwarf and want to make it available to others, just add a pull request that adds your extension to the index in `__init__.py`. Your extension will then be reviewed and if it fulfills all the requirements described in the Contributing Guidelines below, it will be accepted and added to the index.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Of course, your code shouldn't contain any errors at all, but it is generally not a problem if you miss one or two.
- Your code must follow PEP8. If you find this difficult, use PyCharm as PyCharm helps a lot with this.
- Your extension mustn't be of bad quality. If it has some issues that might be fixed easily, I will try to help you.
- Double-check grammar and spelling in all strings that appear to the end user.

Generally speaking, if you need help with anything, feel free to ask for help on [the official Dwarf Discord server](https://discord.me/AileenLumina).
